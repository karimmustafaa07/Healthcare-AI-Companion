# Feature 024: Early Detection of Chest Diseases

## 🧑‍💻 Category:
- Patient-Centered

## 📝 Description:
Combines multiple data sources to flag early signs of respiratory and cardiovascular chest conditions, such as:

- Pneumonia
- Bronchitis
- COPD exacerbation
- Heart failure (via fluid buildup signs)
- Pulmonary embolism (in high-risk users)

## 🔍 Input Sources:
- Cough/breathing audio analysis (feature-023)
- Symptom logs (fever, chest pain, fatigue — feature-025)
- Vital signs: low SpO2 (if device supports), high HR, abnormal BP
- Activity decline (e.g., fewer steps — feature-028)
- Medical history (e.g., prior heart disease — feature-017)

## 🤖 AI Risk Assessment:
- Generates a **Chest Health Score** (Low / Medium / High Risk)
- Example insight:  
  “You’ve logged wet cough + fever + SpO2 92% → possible pneumonia. Seek evaluation.”
- Never diagnoses — only suggests clinical review

## 🔄 Dependencies:
- Audio analysis (feature-023)
- Symptom tracker (feature-025)
- Vitals monitoring (features 004, 005, 009)
- Activity tracking (feature-028)
- AI predictive engine (feature-052)
- Doctor alert system (feature-032)

## 🚨 Action:
- Medium risk → “Consider calling your doctor”
- High risk → “Seek medical attention today” + SOS option (feature-027)
- Summary auto-sent to doctor (with consent — feature-046)

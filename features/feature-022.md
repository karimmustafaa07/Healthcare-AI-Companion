# Feature 022: Real-Time Health Risk Alerts

## 🧑‍💻 Category:
- Patient-Centered

## 📝 Description:
Monitors the patient’s health data in real time and sends immediate alerts if a potentially dangerous pattern is detected.

## ⚠️ Examples of Triggers:
- **High risk combo**: High blood sugar + missed insulin dose + dehydration
- **Vital anomaly**: Resting heart rate >120 BPM for 30+ minutes
- **Trend warning**: Systolic BP rising 20+ points over 3 days
- **Symptom cluster**: Fever + shortness of breath + cough → possible infection

## 🚨 Alert Levels:
- **Yellow (Caution)**: “Your blood pressure is elevated. Rest and recheck in 1 hour.”
- **Red (Urgent)**: “Your heart rate is very high and you logged chest pain. Seek care now.”
- **SOS (Emergency)**: Auto-triggers feature-027 if life-threatening pattern confirmed

- Symptom logger (feature-025)
- Medication tracker (feature-006)
- AI anomaly detection (feature-057)

## 🛡️ Safety Design:

- Never replaces 911 — always advises professional care

# Feature 020: AI Depression Detection from User Writing

## 🧑‍💻 Category:
- Patient-Centered

## 📝 Description:
Uses NLP and machine learning to analyze the patient’s written inputs (journal entries, chat messages, mood notes) for early signs of depression or emotional distress.

## 🔍 Detected Signals:
- Negative sentiment (“I’m worthless”, “Nothing matters”)
- Hopelessness (“I’ll never get better”)
- Social withdrawal (“No one cares”)
- Fatigue language (“Too tired to do anything”)
- Reduced linguistic complexity or increased first-person pronouns

## 🤖 AI Response:
- Gentle check-in: “You’ve been writing a lot about feeling down. Want to talk?”
- Suggest resources: “Try this 5-minute breathing exercise” (linked to feature-012)
- Escalate if high risk: “This sounds serious. Would you like to contact a counselor or your doctor?”
- Never diagnoses — only flags for support

## 🔄 Dependencies:
- Mood journal (feature-019)
- AI NLP engine (feature-059)
- Mental health resource library
- Emergency system (feature-027)
- Doctor alert system (feature-032 — with patient consent)

# Feature 023: Cough and Breathing Sound Analysis

## 🧑‍💻 Category:
- Patient-Centered

## 📝 Description:
Uses the device’s microphone to record and analyze cough or breathing sounds to detect potential respiratory issues.

## 🔊 How It Works:
- User records a 10–30 second audio clip of coughing or normal breathing
- AI analyzes acoustic features:
  - Wheezing
  - Crackles
  - Stridor
  - Wet vs. dry cough
  - Breathing rate & effort

## 🤖 AI Output:
- **Possible indicators**:
  - “Wheezing detected — could suggest asthma or bronchitis”
  - “Coarse crackles — may indicate fluid in lungs”
  - “Rapid, shallow breathing — consider checking oxygen levels”
- **Not a diagnosis** — only a screening suggestion
- Recommends: “Log this with your symptoms” or “Share with your doctor”

- Symptom logger (feature-025)
- AI audio analysis engine (feature-060)
- Doctor dashboard (feature-031)
- Secure sharing (feature-046)

## 🛡️ Privacy & Ethics:
- Audio processed on-device when possible
- Optional cloud analysis (end-to-end encrypted)
- User must consent before recording
- No audio stored unless user saves it
